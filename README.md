# Artilog

**The Artifact Audit System**

A CLI tool for tracking notes, to-dos, and ideas attached to specific files.

### How it works
This tool is **immutable** (append-only).
Unlike standard note apps where you edit and delete, Artilog only lets you add new entries.

**Why?**
I designed it this way to preserve the full history of a file. If I change my mind or fix a mistake, I want to see the path I took to get there, not just the final result.

## Status
**Work in Progress** - Currently building the core database logic.
